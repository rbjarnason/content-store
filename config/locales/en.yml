The ancient Viking religion of Odin is collapsing and Norway is ablaze with civil war, its earls and small kings pitched in battle against \xD3lafur. \xD3lafur preaches one king on earth and one king in heaven and aims to rule over all the lands where the Vikings have settled.

    title: The White Viking Trailer
    text: |-
      The White Viking is the director's third film set in the Viking era.  In this film as well as in the previous ones (When the Raven Flies, In the Shadow of the Raven), the director seeks to destroy the stereotype Viking image made in Hollywood and create a world of new concepts.
      
      The title recalls a certain pagan misconception at the time of Christ being a white-clad Viking conqueror, wielding the cross as a sword to impel worship.  Around 1000 A.D., King Olaf of Norway(Olafur Tryggvason) had nearly succeeded in converting the entire country to Christianity with his sword in one hand and the cross in the other.  The king had visions of a Christian empire, embracing all the lands where the Vikings had settled, including Iceland, a refuge for many pagan opponents of the royal policy in Norway.  Askur, the film's main character, is sent to Iceland, while his bride Embla, is held hostage by King Olaf.  For the love of a woman, Askur sets out on an impossible mission - the conversion of a new nation to Christianity.

They demonstrate their long term commitment to raising awareness of HIV/AIDS in the worst affected region of the world, sub-Saharan Africa.<br/>\r\n\
      <br/>\r\n\
      What makes this show stand out from the rest is the way it doesn't focus on statistics to point out the problems. It shows the real life of children affected by HIV and its associated problems.<br/>\r\n\

      We try to understand the children's story of their emotion, fears and thought from their viewpoint.<br/>\r\n\
